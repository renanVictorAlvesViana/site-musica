<h1>Born to die</h1>

        Why? (Got that?)<br>
    Who, me? (Louder)<br>
    Why? (Got that?)<br>
    Feet don't fail me now<br>
    Take me to the finish line<br>
    Oh, my heart it breaks every step that I take<br>
    But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine<br><br>
    Walking through the city streets<br>
    Is it by mistake or design?<br>
    I feel so alone on the Friday nights<br>
    Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?<br><br>
    It's like I told you, honey (louder)<br>
    Don't make me sad, don't make me cry<br>
    Sometimes love is not enough<br>
    And the road gets tough, I don't know why<br>
    Keep making me laugh<br>
    Let's go get high<br>
    The road is long, we carry on<br>
    Try to have fun in the meantime<br><br>
    Come and take a walk on the wild side<br>
    Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain<br>
    You like your girls insane, so (louder)<br>
    Choose your last words, this is the last time<br>
    'Cause you and I, we were born to die<br><br>
    Lost but now I am found<br>
    I can see that once I was blind<br>
    I was so confused as a little child<br>
    Tryna take what I could get<br>
    Scared that I couldn't find<br>
    All the answers, honey (louder)<br><br>
    Don't make me sad, don't make me cry<br>
    Sometimes love is not enough<br>
    And the road gets tough, I don't know why<br>
    Keep making me laugh<br>
    Let's go get high<br>
    The road is long, we carry on<br>
    Try to have fun in the meantime<br><br>
    Come and take a walk on the wild side<br>
    Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain<br>
    You like your girls insane, so (louder)<br>
    Choose your last words, this is the last time<br>
    'Cause you and I, we were born to die<br><br>
    We were born to die<br>
    (We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)<br>
    We were born to die<br><br>
    Come and take a walk on the wild side<br>
    Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain<br>
    You like your girls insane<br>
    So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry<br>
    Sometimes love is not enough<br>
    And the road gets tough, I don't know why<br>
    Keep making me laugh<br>
    Let's go get high<br>
    The road is long, we carry on<br>
    Try to have fun in the meantime<br><br>
    Come and take a walk on the wild side
